## Overview

Sketching out what a bespoke ssh server for use in a completely trusted
environment (a shadow simulation) might look like. For more context and
discussion see <https://github.com/shadow/shadow/discussions/3671>

## Status

Sort of working as a proof of concept. I think the next step would be to
connect up an authenticated session to a shell process.
